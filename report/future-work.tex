\section{Future Work}
Continuing our development, we would like to allow the addition of new slaves
(including ones that were previously down) into the system while it is running.
We would like to finish the work we have started by implementing more
query plan algorithms and testing their efficiency. We also intend to test
fault tolerance more rigorously through a series of experiments in which
slave nodes fail at random times. Another optimization might be to short circuit
a query that may \code{OR} more vectors, but has obtained a partial vector that
is entirely \code{1}s. Furthermore, we can improve the $O(\log N)$ performance
given by consistent hashing by using dynamic partitioning of the bitmap
vectors, as described in \cite{kleppman2017}.
