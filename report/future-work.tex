\section{Future Work}
We would like to finish the work we have started by implementing more
query plan algorithms and testing their efficiency. We also intend to test
fault tolerance more rigorously through a series of experiments in which
slave nodes fail at random times. Another optimization might be to short circuit
a query that may OR more vectors, but has obtained a partial vector that
is entirely \code{1}s.
