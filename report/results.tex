\section{Results}
We have tested our system comprising 6 slave nodes against a centralized system making no RPCs.
The distributed system was found to take noticeably longer to handle a batch of bitmap queries of any given size
(\(0 \leq q \leq 1200\), where \(q\) is the number of queries) than the centralized one.
The graph below shows that the distributed system required time \(t_d(q) = 0.0045q + 0.07\) with \(R^2 = 0.9919\)
while the centralized system followed the line \(t_c(q) = 0.0002q - 0.0023\) with \(R^2 = 0.9818\).
Since the slope of \(t_d(q)\) surpasses the slope of \(t_c(q)\) we expect the distributed system to perform much more slowly.
This is due to the time required to perform RPCs and execute the query planner.
Despite the worse performance, using a distributed system
