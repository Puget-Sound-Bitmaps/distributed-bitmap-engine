Dynamo \cite{decandia2007} is a key-value store designed by Amazon. DBIE drew
inspiration from Dynamo in the choice of hashing algorithm used to locate
vectors, but it is different from Dynamo (and open source distributed data
stores such as Voldemort \cite{voldemort} and Redis \cite{redis}) because it
was designed to process queries using multiple nodes, instead of just storing
and retrieving data.

Pilosa \cite{pilosa} is a distributed bitmap engine built by the eponymous
company in 2017. It uses the Roaring Bitmaps \cite{roaring} compression
algorithm, was written in the Go programming language, and runs each node in a
cluster in lieu of using the master-slave model. Pilosa also allows data
replication on multiple nodes. Due to differences in intended use,
Pilosa was not a large influence upon the design of DBIE.
