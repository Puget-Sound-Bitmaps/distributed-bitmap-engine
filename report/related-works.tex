DBIE draws inspiration from Dynamo \cite{decandia2007}, Amazon's distributed
key-value store, in the choice of hashing algorithm used to locate vectors.

Pilosa \cite{pilosa} is a distributed bitmap engine built by the eponymous
company in 2017. It uses the Roaring Bitmaps \cite{roaring} compression
algorithm, was written in the Go programming language, and runs each node in a
cluster in lieu of using the master-slave model. Pilosa also allows data
replication on multiple machines. Due to differences in intended use,
Pilosa was not a large influence upon the design of DBIE.
