\section{Introduction}
As datasets grow to be terabytes---or even petabytes---in size, performing
queries on them can become prohibitively time-consuming if not done
efficiently. An example of such a situation could be performing a query on US
census data (see Table~\ref{table:census-relational} for a small set of example
data). If we were to search for all Americans with salaries of at least
\SI{100000}[\$]{} who are also under the age of 50 (equivalent to the SQL query
\code{SELECT * FROM CENSUS WHERE SALARY~>~\$100000 AND AGE~<~50}), we would have to scan each
line (tuple) in the database sequentially. Even on fast computers a read from
disk can take upwards of \SI{15}{\milli\second} and the US population is
roughly \num{326000000} necessitating a \SI{15}{\milli\second} read for each tuple. As a result, this query could take
\(\num{326 000 000} \times \SI{15}{\milli\second} = \SI{1400}{\hour}\)
which is just under two months; obviously queries cannot take this long.

One method of improving query execution time is to use a \term{bitmap index}. A
bitmap index is a collection of binary strings that represent truth values
pertaining to a relational database (see Tables~\ref{table:census-salary} and
\ref{table:census-age} for possible indexes of age and salary information in
Table~\ref{table:census-relational}).  In this paper we refer to each string as
a \term{bitmap vector}. Queries on such a bitmap index can satisfy common
database queries---such as the SQL query given above---and are very efficient
as they consist primarily of machine-level bitwise operators. To satisfy the query,
we first find all Americans who make over \SI{100000}[\$]{} by \code{OR}ing
vectors \(v_3\) (Americans with salaries between \SI{100000}[\$]{} and
\SI{300000}[\$]{}) and \(v_4\) (Americans with salaries over \SI{300000}[\$]{}).
Second, we find all Americans under the age of 50 by \code{OR}ing bitmap vectors
\(v_4\), \(v_5\), and \(v_6\) which will include all Americans under the age of 66 (which is a superset of the tuples relevant to the query). After \code{AND}ing together the two ranges, we
will be left with a bitmap vector where the rows with a value of \code{1} correspond
to Americans who \emph{may} satisfy our original query. To find the exact query return value,
the original tuples corresponding to the rows with \code{1}s must be scanned.
While this may result in some tuples being scanned that do not satisfy the query,
the number of tuples scanned is \emph{significantly} fewer than in a naive sequential scan.

A system comprising multiple computers (\term{nodes}) is known as a
\term{distributed system}. In comparison, a system containing only one node is
called a \term{centralized system}. The principal advantages of using a
distributed system over a centralized system are twofold: first, there is no
single point of failure, and second, the storage capacity of the system in
aggregate can reach sized infeasible for a centralized system. Should an
individual node in a distributed system, the data can be redistributed such
that there is again a backup of all data in the system. Such resilience to
hardware (or software) failure cannot be be obtained in a centralized system,
and as a results, a failure would necessitate regenerating the entire index.
\par
The purpose of our system (hereafter called DBIE) is to expand upon the
functionality of Chiu, et al.'s bitmap engine by distributing a set of bitmap
vectors, and the work of executing bitmap queries, among multiple nodes. Our
system is designed to be capable of recovering from single-node failure at any
point during execution. Our approach was to handle vector input and query
requests from a database management system (DBMS) via a \term{master}
\term{process} (a program in execution) on the same node as the
DBMS. In order to store vectors and satisfy queries, the master sends
replicas of the vector to two distinct nodes (\term{slaves}), and to satisfy
queries, the master delegates work to the slaves that have the requisite
vectors.
