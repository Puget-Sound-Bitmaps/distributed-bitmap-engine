We have implemented a distributed system that reliably stores a bitmap index
and supports distributed queries on the index. The system uses WAH bitmap
compression, Two-Phase Commit to ensure vectors arrive at their destination
slaves, and consistent hashing for determining the locations of bitmap vectors.
The system also provides an easily extendable framework for further research on
in interplay between distributed systems and bitmap indexes. Experimental
results confirm that query execution time in the distributed system is slower
than on a centralized system, however the benefits of fault tolerance and
increased storage capacity in aggregate provide capabilities not available in a
centralized system.
