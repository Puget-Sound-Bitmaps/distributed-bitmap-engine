We have implemented a distributed system that reliably stores a bitmap index
and supports distributed queries on the index. The system uses WAH bitmap
compression, 2PC for data consistency, and consistent hashing for determining
the locations of bitmap vectors. The system also provides an easily extendable
framework for further research on in interplay between distributed systems
and bitmap indexes. Experimental results confirm that query execution time in
the distributed system is slower than on a centralized system, however the
benefits of fault tolerance and increased storage capacity in aggregate provide
capabilities not available in a centralized system.
