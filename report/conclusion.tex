\section{Conclusion}
There are no other known distributed bitmap index systems
that use WAH bitmap compression. Our system could be easily extended to be
compatible with more compression schemes (besides Roaring, implemented in
Pilosa), as it is not designed with a specific
compression algorithm in mind. Thus, it can serve as a framework for evaluating
different bitmap compression schemes in the context of distributed systems.
Since fault-tolerant distributed systems are challenging to program \cite{kleppmann} we hope that
further work on our system will lead to new techniques in systems programming.
